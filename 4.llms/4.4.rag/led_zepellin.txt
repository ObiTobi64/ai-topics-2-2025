Titulo: Stairway To heaven

There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there, she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon
If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring-clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you, at last
When all are one and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Titulo: All My Love
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light?
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last, the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Aryan, one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
Yes, all of my love to you, child

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you now
All of my love, oh-ooh-oh
Yes, all of my love to you now

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love, love
Sometimes, sometimes, yeah
Sometimes, sometimes, oh-woah

Hey, hey, hey, ayy
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, yeah
It's all, all, all, all

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to, to you, and you, and you, yeah

I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Titulo: Immigrant Song

We came from the land
Of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs blow

The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, singing and crying
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep
With threshing oar
Our only goal
Will be the western shore

We came from the land
Of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs flow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep
With threshing oar
Our only goal
Will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing
